    "Step 1: Understanding the Uniform Prior\n",
    "The given prior π(a) = 1 for all a ∈ ℝ is an improper uniform prior\n",
    "A uniform prior assigns equal probability to all possible values\n",
    "In this case, π(a) = 1 is constant across the entire real line\n",
    "This matches the definition of a uniform prior\n",
    "Step 2: First Statement - Is π(a) a uniform prior?\n",
    "Since π(a) = 1 for all a ∈ ℝ\n",
    "This assigns equal weight to all possible values of a\n",
    "This is precisely the definition of a uniform prior\n",
    "Therefore, this statement is TRUE\n",
    "Step 3: Understanding Jeffreys Prior\n",
    "Jeffreys prior is proportional to the square root of Fisher Information\n",
    "For a Gaussian linear model Y = aX + ε:\n",
    "The likelihood is L(Y|a,X) ∝ exp(-(y-ax)²/(2σ²))\n",
    "Fisher Information I(a) = (x²/σ²)\n",
    "Jeffreys prior would be π(a) ∝ √(x²/σ²) = |x|/σ\n",
    "Step 4: Second Statement - Is π(a) a Jeffreys prior?\n",
    "The given prior π(a) = 1 is constant\n",
    "Jeffreys prior would be proportional to |x|/σ\n",
    "These are not equivalent\n",
    "Therefore, this statement is FALSE\n",
    "Final Answer\n",
    "\"π(a) is a uniform prior\" - TRUE\n",
    "\"π(a) is a Jeffreys prior\" - FALSE\n",
