    "# Parametric Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "## Statistical formulation:\n",
    "* Consider a sample $\\, X_1,\\, \\ldots ,\\, X_ n\\,$ of i.i.d. random variables and a statistical model $(\\mathbb E,(\\mathbf{P}_\\theta) \\theta \\in \\Theta)$\n",
    "* **Let $\\Theta_0$ and $\\Theta_1$ be disjoint subsets of $\\Theta$**.\n",
    "* Conside the two hypotheses: $\\begin{cases} H_0 &: \\theta \\in \\Theta_0\\\\H_1 &: \\theta \\in \\Theta_1\\end{cases}$\n",
    "* $H_0$ is the **null hypothesis**, $H_1$ is the **alternative hypothesis**.\n",
    "* If we believe that the true $\\theta$ is either in $\\Theta_0$ or in $\\Theta_1$, we may want to **test $H_0$ against $H_1$**.\n",
    "* We want to decide whether to **reject** $H_0$(look for evidence against $H_0$ in the data.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\Theta_1$ lies on only one side of $\\Theta_0$, this is called a one sided test. If $\\Theta_1$ lies on both sides of $\\Theta_0$, this is called a two sided test.\n",

    "Remark:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the question is \"whether this hospital has longer waiting time than average?\" We state the hypothesis as $H_0:\\mu≤30;H1:\\mu>30$, where H1 is what we are looking for evidence in the data to show. Intuitively, if it is \"innocnet\" at the end, we did not find enough evidence to prove that it is \"guilty\". And the burden is on the trial to bring evidence. But if you walk away free, it does not mean that it is \"innocnet\". It is just that we were not able to bring enough evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the data, our conclusion will never be to **accept** the null. On observing the data, we will either **reject** the null in favor of the alternative OR we will **fail to reject** the null. In the latter case, we are not claiming that the null is true, rather we are stating that the data does not provide us with enough evidence to refute the null hypothesis.\n",

    "## Asymmetry Asymmetry in the hypothesis\n",
    "* $H_0$ and $H_1$ do not play a symmetric role: the data is only used to try to disprove $H_0$\n",
    "* In particular lack of evidence, does not mean that $H_0$ is true (\" innocent until proven guilty\")\n",
    "* A (statistical) test is a statistic $\\psi \\in \\{0,1\\}$, which does not depend explicitly on the value of true unknown parameter, such that:\n",
